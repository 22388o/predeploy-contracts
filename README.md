# Predeploy-contracts

Generate bytecode for predeployment of ERC20 smart contracts in Acala.

## Build

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Generate bytecode

To generate bytecode, run `yarn run generate-bytecode`.

The generated bytecode JSON file would be `./resources/bytecodes.json`. The contracts are in `./contracts/tmp/` directory.

## Development

The token list for ERC20 smart contracts is in `./resources/tokens.json`. Name, symbol and Currency ID bytes are needed for each token, for instance:

```
{
  "name": "ACA",
  "symbol": "ACA",
  "currencyId": "0x0000"
}
```
